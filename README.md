### Overview

This analysis runs a comprehensive analysis of the pizza sales data. Using SQL queries, Power BI dashboards, I was able to provide actionable insights into business performance. This analysis targets key performance indicators (KPIs) and visual trends, ultimately empowering stakeholders to make data-driven decisions.

### Objective

The goal is to analyse key performance indicators (KPIs) and visualise trends in pizza sales data to understand business performance, customer preferences, and operational efficiency. The analysis will help in making data-driven decisions to improve sales and customer satisfaction.

### Insights

-  **Revenue and Order Performance:**  
  The analysis illustrates that the total revenue generated from pizza sales reached **$817,000**, with an average order value of **$38.31**. The data indicates that **21,350 orders** were placed during the period, with weekend days, especially Friday and Saturday recording as high as **3,500 and 3,200 orders** respectively, compared to the average order on weekdays. This trend suggests a significant uplift in customer engagement during weekends.

- **Product Category Performance:**  
  The 'Classic' pizza category emerged as the strongest performer with **10,859 orders**, constituting **27%** of total revenue. 'Supreme' pizzas contributed **9,085 orders** (25%), and 'Veggie' and 'Chicken' pizzas accounted for the remaining **48%**.

- **Pizza Size Distribution:**  
  Analysis across the dataset indicates that the **Large** pizza size is most popular, commanding **12,736 orders** (45% of pizza sales). The **Medium** size follows with **11,159 orders** (30%), and the **Regular** size comprises **22%** of orders. This insight supports a refined approach to inventory and promotional strategy, aligning product availability with customer demand.

- **Top and Bottom Performers:**  
  This analysis highlights that the top 5 pizza variants by revenue average **$40,000** each, reflecting strong market appeal. In contrast, the bottom 5 variants average just **$14,400**, signaling areas for potential menu reevaluation. Notably, the highest-selling pizza variant by quantity achieved **2,453 units sold**, whereas the lowest-selling variant recorded only **490 units**. These metrics provide a clear segmentation for further product development and marketing focus.

### Recommendations

-  **Targeted Marketing & Promotions:**

    **Peak Days:** Leverage a 20–30% increase in orders during weekends by launching targeted promotions.

    **Popular Categories:** Capitalise on the strong performance of the 'Classic' category and large-sized pizzas that contribute to larger % of revenue to boost engagement and sales.

-  **Operational Optimisation:**

    **Inventory & Production:** Align production schedules with the observed daily and monthly sales trends to minimize waste and meet demand. 
  
    **Upselling Strategies:** Implement bundled deals around top-selling items to potentially increase the average order value by 10–15% and enhance operational efficiency.

-  **Menu Optimisation:**

    **Review Underperformers:** Reassess pizzas in the bottom 5 (less than 10–15% of revenue) for possible revamp or discotinuation.

    **Product Diversification:** Explore opportunities for new offerings based on detailed breakdowns by category and size to revitalise the menu and capture untapped market segments.

### Conclusion

The comprehensive analysis of our pizza sales data over the entire dataset period has yielded robust insights into revenue trends, customer behavior, and product performance. By focusing on key metrics and leveraging both SQL and Power BI tools, we have identified clear opportunities for targeted promotions, menu refinement, and operations optimisation.
